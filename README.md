## General Information
Tweets are a great source of feedbacks. If companies leverage the Twitter API to fetch tweets mentioning them, they can understand how customers feel about their products and improve accordingly.

However, there could be tens of thousands of tweets everyday. To filter out feedbacks which are related to a certain department, text mining and logistic regression can be deployed. 

In this project, I used a dataset of tweets mentioning Trans-American Airline and build models to find those that are related to 'customer service issues'.

## Libraries Used
